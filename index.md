Here you'll find guides to using all the parts in your Arduino starter kit. I don't have an actual kit so I'm using a picture of the contents as a guide.  
The parts are divided into input-objects and output-objects. Use the inputs to gather data (they send stuff to your Arduino) and use the outputs to display data or control them directly from your Arduino (they need instructions from your Arduino to work).  
You'll find a short description, a link to an online tutorial and an assignment for each object. I suggest you first follow and finish the tutorial before doing the assignment.  
If you need any help don't hesitate to send me an email.
