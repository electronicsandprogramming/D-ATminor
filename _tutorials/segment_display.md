The 7-segment display module is built up of seven separate leds (eight if it has a dot as well). By controlling which led is on and off you can create letters and numbers (kind of...).   
There are two types available: one has all the positive leads of the leds connected (common anode) and the other all the negative leads (common cathode). See the tutorial for checking the one you have.  
By combining multiple displays you can create a number display or show simple words.
