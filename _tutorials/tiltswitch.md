A tilt-sensor, the cheapo version, is available in two versions: one has a small ball inside which will make contact between two pins if you tilt it, the other has a blob of mercury inside which will move and make contact between two pins when tilted. So "tilt-switch" would be the more correct name.  

Note: this is not a true tilt-sensor that can register the degree of tilt-angle. For that you need a gyroscope which is built into the [9-dof sensor board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3463).
