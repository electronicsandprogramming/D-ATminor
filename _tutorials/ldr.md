assignment: Build a light switch which switches a motor or light on/off. You can also build a kind of Theremin by generating a tone based on the value you read from the sensor.

A photoresistor (Light-Dependent Resistor) is a resistor that changes value if light shines on it. You can use it as a potentiometer but as it only has two 'legs' instead of three you have to add a third one with an extra resistor (see tutorial).
