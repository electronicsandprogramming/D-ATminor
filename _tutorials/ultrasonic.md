An ultrasonic (distance) sensor sends out a small ultrasonic sound signal and detects the returning bounces. By calculating the time between send and receive you can calculate the distance between an object and the sensor.  
The range is between 2 cm and 4 meters.  

Note: there are different types which each have their own specific code/library so check the one you have if the code doesn't work.
